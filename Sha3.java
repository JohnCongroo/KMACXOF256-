    In this section, the KECCAK-p permutations are specified, with two parameters: 1) the fixed
    length of the strings that are permuted, called the width of the permutation, and 2) the number of
    iterations of an internal transformation, called a round. The width is denoted by b, and the
    number of rounds is denoted by nr. The KECCAK-p permutation with nr rounds and width b is
    denoted by KECCAK-p[b, nr]; the permutation is defined for any b in {25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800,
    1600} and any positive integer nr.
